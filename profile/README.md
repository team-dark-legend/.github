Not that long ago, a race of monsters lived below the surface peacefully, hoping for the day they'd see the sun.

They had been underground for centuries due to the BARRIER, a powerful spell that could only be broken by a creature with the powers of a GOD. To achieve that power, the king needed the power of seven human SOULS.

Close to their goal, a ruthless murderer started causing fear and murder around the reign. 
King ASGORE and many others had disappeared overnight accompanied by the human SOULS, causing the long-missing queen to come back. Enraged by the queen's new policy of non-hostility towards humans, UNDYNE, captain of the ROYAL GUARD, spearheaded a rebellion that banished the QUEEN from the throne and appointed herself as the EMPRESS of the Underground.
